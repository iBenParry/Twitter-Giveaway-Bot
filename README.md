# Twitter-Giveaway-Bot
Automatically engages with tweets that are giving away goods and follows Twitter's ToS so there's no chance of your API getting shut down.

Requirements:
Check the modules imported in the bot and make sure you have them all installed, but you'll mainly just need to download Tweepy.

Setup:
1. Prepare a Twitter account you wish to use this bot on.
2. Go to http://apps.twitter.com and create a new application with your desired title and description.
3. Once created, go to the "Keys and Access Tokens" tab at the top of the page, here is the information you'll need to hook your Twitter    account to the bot.
4. Download the bot, edit the file and change the placeholder text for the four keys to the keys you've just created for your               application, as well as including your Twitter handle where the placeholder text is.
5. That's it. Run the bot and it'll get to work right away. It's not perfect since it's my first time using modules such as Tweepy, so      work will be done overtime to update this.
